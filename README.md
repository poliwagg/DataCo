# **DataCo Supply Chain Analysis**
This project uses public dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis). It also uses Snowflake as the database management system to store, process, and clean the data, while Python is used for exploratory data analysis and visualization. The processed results are then presented through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
